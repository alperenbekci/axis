## 🤔 Why Axis Agent?

Accessing blockchain data is often complex and requires technical expertise. Users struggle with blockchain explorers to check accounts, track transactions, and analyze network health. Developers face inefficiencies due to scattered and complex documentation.

Axis Agent simplifies this process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and an AI-powered query engine, allowing users to effortlessly access blockchain insights through simple text commands.
